# Weather App
## Purpose and Explanation
I have designed an application for a weather organization for the users to keep track of different information regarding the weather of each day/of that week. The user can clear and update any day of the weeks information if they have inputted it wrong. The app automatically calculates the average temperature of the week with the provided information. There is also an extra screen that displays the day of the week, the minimum temperature, the maximum temperature and the weather condition of the respecting day. 

I decided to go with a simple colour scheme that represents the colours of the sky, using multiple shades of blue and white. I had also decided to use a simple image of the sun as the logo of the app, as to keep in theme with the “sky” theme. The background of the application uses a light blue while the buttons and text use a dark blue that contrasts and makes it easy to read. 

I have provided screenshots of each screen of the application and a guide on how to use it below:

### Screen 1 (Splash Screen)
Open the application up onto its main splash screen.

Here you will find 2 buttons, the “Main Menu” button & the “Exit” button.

Main Menu takes you to the main menu of the application.

Exit will close the application.

### Screen 2 (Main Menu)
Welcome to the Main Menu.

At the top you will find the average temperature of the week.

Under that you will be able to select any day of the week and see the minimum temperature, maximum temperature and condition of the weather.

You can choose to clear a specific days information and update it with the correct information with the respective buttons.

After that you can either go back to the Splash Screen or proceed onwards to the Detailed View screen.

### Screen 3 (Detailed View)
Welcome to the Detailed View Screen.

Here you can find specifics on every single day of the week.

If you would like to return to the Main Menu you can just press the button at the bottom.
